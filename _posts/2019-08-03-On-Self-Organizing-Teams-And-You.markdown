This past week I went to California with my family. To kick off my PTO (Paid Time Off from work), my eight year old son and I had a father-son camping event with the 8-11 year old boys at our church and their fathers. I was on-call over the weekend so my laptop tagged along.

It was a challenge to get going. My son was excited, asked lots of questions about what we should bring, and had the car all packed except for my personal stuff. We were supposed to meet up with the group at 4pm on Friday. I worked from my home office until 3:45pm. As I finally started packing, I got two direct messages on chat from two different people at work. People from work rarely send messages just to say hello.

I finally sat down in the driver’s seat of our 4WD Hyundai Tucson at 4:10. But it wouldn’t start! This is always a risk since the car isn’t a daily driver anymore. It was parked in the gravel pad adjacent to our garage with the engine facing away from the street, so we enlisted my wife’s help and pushed it towards the street so we could give the car a jump start from another vehicle. It started right up. I let the car run for at least ten minutes while doing last-minute things, including the extrication of the four year old boy from the vehicle (he was very sad to see us go without him).

Now it’s 4:40. We drive to the church to meet up, but everyone’s gone. No surprise there. We head for the grocery store to pick up a sack lunch...because my 15 minutes to prepare were cut in half by work chat. While we are at the store, we meet another father and son combo who also missed the main group. They left before us. When I went to start the Tucson, it wouldn’t start (again).

It’s after 5:00 p.m. now. The hood is up. Wife has been called. A nice lady stopped to ask if we needed a jump. She spent a few minutes with us and we couldn’t get it started. Nice lady leaves. Wife is still on her way (there is a crying boy at home to consider). A friend from church walks up and asks if we need help, says he had this problem just the day before. He pulls up the family vehicle, with his wife and kids in tow (and it’s their wedding anniversary!) and we try the jump start process again. They sit with us for ten minutes while he revs the engine to try and push excess power into our dead battery.

I don’t even know what time it is at this point. The father we saw in the store earlier calls. He says there’s been a flash flood and the road to camp is washed out. He advises we turn around. I say that should be pretty easy since we’re still in the parking lot. He’s immediately more concerned about me than himself, but I tell him we’re in good hands.

I report the news to my friend, his family, and my wife who just arrived. The weather doesn’t look great in the grocery store parking lot either. He says he needs to make another couple calls to some other late fathers he knows about. We finally get the Tucson started, and head back home. My son is in tears.

At home, I don’t want to talk to anyone. I’m so frustrated at how hard it seemed to be to leave work that day. I was also nervous about the family road trip to California that was supposed to start the next afternoon. And the water sprinklers. 

Earlier in the week, my son had brought me part of a sprinkler head. I said we should probably check the sprinklers to see if it was ours - but I wasn’t sure it was. I’d been so focused on work that I pushed off testing that theory, even after a daily reminder from my wise offspring. 

Sometime on Friday morning, my son pulls me out of my office to speak to our next door neighbor over who is in our driveway. He said his wife woke him up at 2am because she heard water running at full speed. He figured out it was from our sprinkler system and probably got soaking wet as he turned down the water pressure provided by the city. He says the pressure coming from the city is always too high and if you’re not careful the sprinkler heads will blow off. We finally do that sprinkler check, and there are FOUR heads missing, not just one. I turned off the water in that sprinkler region and punted on the problem, saying I’d fix it Saturday afternoon after camping but before leaving for California. Getting in a full day of work seemed too important.

Now that we’re not going camping because of the flash flood I have time to fix the sprinklers. I’d never done this before. I took a different vehicle and set out for Home Depot. I knew there was a second (longer) route to reach the campsite, so I stopped in at AutoZone first. In my head the problem was that the alternator wasn’t charging the battery, so I bought an $350 alternator for the Tucson and planned to spend my evening replacing it. I also bought some headlamps for my other car. 

It was the headlamps that got me thinking about WalMart. I remembered WalMart had better prices on headlamps. So I headed over there and realized en-route that I should probably try some battery repair tools before going whole hog on the alternator. They had what I was looking for in both cases.

At some point during my outing it started raining. I found what I was looking for at Home Depot (I hoped). I got home, fixed three of the four sprinklers (in the rain), made the requisite second trip to Home Depot for the right size sprinkler head, and returned home to replace the last head. It’s dark outside. I align the sprinkler heads so as not to waste too much water. and 

It’s still Friday night. It’s after 10:00 pm. I want to drive the Tucson to the campsite in the morning. The alternate route is twice as long. We’ll have to leave at 6am to make the start time of the planned activities. But do we have an alternator problem or a battery problem? I’m not sure. I did not have the stamina to do an overnight car repair job, so I plugged in the battery repair tool and asked it to recondition the battery. I went to bed. At least I wouldn’t have to fix the sprinklers tomorrow.

Six am came very very quickly. The battery tool said the repair had succeeded, so I woke up my boy. We prayed, had some cold cereal, and got in the Tucson. It started! Two hours and three bags of treats later, we were with our friends that had reached camp safely the night before. 

We learned that the flood happened right as our friends reached that very section of road. Two vehicles were in front of the flood, two were in between flooded sections, and two more were just reaching the area as the flood started. The last set of vehicles returned home for the night. They were delayed by road crews. The middle set took the alternate route and got to camp late. We would have been right in the middle of it all had we not been blocked by battery problems.

The camp activities were great. The vehicles that went home Friday night had also taken the alternate route on Saturday morning. The boys got to ride a rope swing, do a ropes course, and ride a zip line (definitely firsts for my son). Since no one made it to dinner the night before, we had that for lunch. We went home full and happy.

A quick 90 minutes after our return, my family took off for California. I slept off the first few hours in the back seat of the van with my travel CPAP machine. I’d already had a couple of quick scares driving back from camp. We only had to make it to Winnemucca, Nevada, about six hours away.

On Sunday morning we went to church at one of the wards where I served as a missionary 19 years before. I saw a friendly face - he was the Bishop of the ward when I was there. There were several other faces that I recognized, but I wasn’t able to call up any memories besides working with the Bishop. Winnemucca has Casinos, but it’s really a mining town and a stopping point on Interstate 80. When gold prices are high, lots of new people are around. When prices are down, people leave for other mines in other states.

We got on the road again after church. We stopped to see the Reno Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It was dedicated while I served in Winnemucca. It was good to share stories about those times with my children. It was also windy, but not blow dryer windy - that was nice. A cooler day in the desert.

We traversed winding roads through the Sierra Nevadas and eventually arrived in Angels Camp, a prime location during the Gold Rush of the mid-1800s. We visited a local museum where the kids and my sweetheart wife panned for gold. We eventually had to tell the eight year old that it was Iron Pyrite. They had a full-size water wheel in its original moorings, along with the attached pummeling tool for smashing rocks to (hopefully) break out more gold.

We also stopped in at Yosemite National Park. We walked a trail to the lower waterfall in Yosemite Valley, and saw Halfdome in the distance. The walls of granite were so tall. I was left to wonder what prevented the valley from being pushed to such great heights. At dusk the boys and I climbed a peak somewhere towards Tuolumne to watch the sunset, and play airplane on a rock.

To ensure I was focused on family, I uninstalled ‘Hangouts Chat’ from my phone on Monday morning after my on-call shift ended, stopped syncing my work email, and didn’t look back for four days. It was totally uneventful (except for the biting flies at Calaveras Big Trees State Park -- we still have welts). Our teenage daughter didn’t complain about my use of technology even once. At least not to my face. She seemed pleased with the trip overall, perfectly normal ‘I don’t want to go’ comments aside. They were mild.

Wednesday we drove twelve hours straight home, arriving at 2am Thursday. The teenage daughter had youth conference with the 14-18 year olds in our church ward. The rest of us bummed around the house, which was cleaned before we left, as per my wife’s practice and diligence. It was calm.

For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to go back to work on Friday. That was dumb. One of these days I’ll get a clue. I read all the chats and emails and saw all the week’s challenges, and I couldn’t think of anything nice to say to anyone about anything at work. 

It had been a rotten week at work. I wasn’t the only one on vacation - three of the four of my team members were out. The one remaining is our resident expert on most things. Of course several problems converged while we were out and he put in lots of extra hours. We were called out in chat (as a team) for letting him take that burden alone. It stung. We had talked about the vacation schedule as a team, although it was last minute, and agreed it was acceptable.

I started this letter so I could write about how frustrated I was with work on Friday. I wanted to write about the 'self-organizing teams' we have at work and and the core problems that led to the rotten week for my team mate that tried valiantly to carry the load. But now that I’m here I’d rather eat ice cream. It’s Friday night, after all, and on-call starts again tomorrow.

The most important self-organizing team I know of is the one I started with my loving wife 17 years ago. We had a great week together.
