This is my second attempt at maintaining a blog. But the first attempt was just for my scouts. 

I was serving as an eleven-year-old scout leader in our ward (our church unit). I thought it would be fun to have our new scouts write about their experiences each week. As it turned out, getting more than two written sentences per week out of a group of eleven year old boys was challenging.

That blog lasted about three weeks. Hopefully, this one lasts longer.
