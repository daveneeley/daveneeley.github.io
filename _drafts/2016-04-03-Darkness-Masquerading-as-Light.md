Several months ago I testified about darkness and light in church. It's something I've been pondering. As a software engineer, I spend a considerable amount of time in front of a screen. Laptop, phone, desktop, or tablet. These digital screens are brilliantly colored. They are bright like the sun. But what *kind* of light do they bring into my life? Come with me as I try to compare and contrast the light of a brilliant digital screen and the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Let us begin at the beginning. "And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the starts also." [Genesis 1:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.16?lang=eng#15) This is the light of the sun and the light of the moon. The moon does not in and of itself give light -- it reflects the light of the sun. The stars do give their own light. We now know the light from stars to be the light of other suns much more distant, and in somes cases much larger, than our own sun.

I've begun to take an interest in astronomy, which you might call the study of light in space. Remember those lessons in your physics class about wavelengths and the visible spectrum? Everything we surmise about objects in space is based on our observations of the light emitted by these objects. The 'observable universe' is the catalog of all the light we can see in outer space. Now, with Hubble and other satellites, we are taking pictures of objects that are further and further away from Earth, thus increasing the size of the observable universe. It's fascinating. As I'm writing this, I'm looking at a [skyscape of the constellation Cepheus](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100909.html).

The study of light isn't just for space geeks. Our use of light on Earth has great implications, particularly in this age of brilliant screens. For most of our existence we lived by the light of a fire, beit a bonfire or candle. The light of the sun is so bright that a fire in broad daylight is difficult to see, but this is not true for a digital screen. Computer screens are designed to look like the sun. How else could you see them in broad daylight?

A few years ago I was having problems with my eyes watering all the time. While it's true that I'm a sentimental guy and it doesn't take much to get me to cry, this was different. My eyes would be fine in the summer, and water from November to April. I had seen some software developers wear yellow-tinted lenses while working, to protect their eyes from the blue light emitted from a computer screen. I started researching this as a potential reason for my eyes to water and came across an application called [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). From the website:

	"Ever notice how people texting at night have that eerie blue glow?

	Or wake up ready to write down the Next Great Idea, and get blinded by your computer screen?

	During the day, computer screens look good-they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun."

The f.lux application "makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night, and like sunlight during the day" and surmises that the light of your computer screen, specifically the blue light, could even be keeping you up at night. There is [research](https://justgetflux.com/research.html) backing up this claim.

I started using f.lux on all my computers, and found a compareable application for my phone. I also stopped wearing sunglasses during the winter months. All of this seems to have helped -- my eye condition did not return last winter.

"For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light" [Psalms 36:9]("https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/36.9?lang=eng#8")

"That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day." [Doctrine and Covenants 50:24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24?lang=eng#23)

"And now I give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkenth to the voice of the Spirit." [Doctrine and Covenants 84:43-46](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.43?lang=eng#44)

"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." [Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng)

"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one." [Doctrine and Covenants 93:36-37](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35)

"Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God. And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers. But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth." [Doctrine and Covenants 93:38-40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.38?lang=eng#35)

I have a note written in my study notebook about these verses: "Irony - television is a very common way for taking away light and truth, and it is done by providing a false light.  TV, phones, computers, all of it -- all devices filled with light...what we do with the light determines what we learn from it."

"Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place" [Doctrine and Covenants 93:48](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.48?lang=eng#47)

"more diligent and concerned at home" - verse 50
