Several months ago I testified about darkness and light in church. It's something I've been pondering. As a software engineer, I spend a considerable amount of time in front of a screen. Laptop, phone, desktop, or tablet. These digital screens are brilliantly colored. They are bright like the sun. But what *kind* of light do they bring into my life? Come with me as I try to compare and contrast the light of a brilliant digital screen and the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night" [Genesis 1:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/1.16?lang=eng#15)

"For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light" [Psalms 36:9]("https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/ps/36.9?lang=eng#8")

"That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day." [Doctrine and Covenants 50:24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50.24?lang=eng#23)

"And now I give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life. For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkenth to the voice of the Spirit." [Doctrine and Covenants 84:43-46](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.43?lang=eng#44)

"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." [Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng)

"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. Light and truth forsake that evil one." [Doctrine and Covenants 93:36-37](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng#35)

"Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God. And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers. But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth." [Doctrine and Covenants 93:38-40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.38?lang=eng#35)

I have a note written in my study notebook about these verses: "Irony - television is a very common way for taking away light and truth, and it is done by providing a false light.  TV, phones, computers, all of it -- all devices filled with light...what we do with the light determines what we learn from it."
