I served for eighteen months as a Chartered Organization Representative for our local scout troop. Our troop is part of the Great Salt Lake Council, which uses patchfunding.com for administering the annual Friends of Scouting drive. These drives happen all across the nation, but patchfunding appears to only be used by three councils. The application could definitely use a little 'fit and finish', but all the key components are there.

Our council is predominately made up of units chartered by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. These units are organized geographically. Thus when we do Friends of Scouting, we organize it geographically as well. Each unit is assigned to knock every door within their geographical boundaries, which is no small task. We were also asked to get a definite yes or no from each address, with callbacks.

Being the analytical person that I am, I thought the most accurate way to ensure everyone was asked to donate was to make sure every address in our unit was in the patchfunding software. So I took the map of our geographical unit, then went to the online county records and downloaded the name and address of every homeowner on my map. Then I downloaded all of the existing donor records from patchfunding, normalized them, and cross referenced them with the homeowner list to find the names and addresses I did not already have. All of this was done with Microsoft Excel. I found there were 398 addresses in my unit, 50% of which were not in patchfunding.

Patchfunding has the concept of routes, but the UI doesn't make sense for 400 addresses. If by chance you are here trying to evaluate whether or not your council should buy this software, all I can say is...don't.I have ranted about it several times and written both the developers and the council. The council was sympathetic, and the developers never responded. But ranting didn't get me removed from the assignment, so I found a way to make it work. I've been meaning to write about since that first experience. Now we'll go through everything step-by-step. Hopefully this will help you make complete routes and get the most out of this underwhelming software. After all, the point is to help the boys by providing them with great facilities and great leadership.
