#Setup
This post covers first-time setup of records on patchfunding.com. Once you have every address imported, it's all just maintenance -- but Heaven forbid your unit boundaries change!

## Get a Map
For this to work, you need a map with all the street addresses in your unit. Some people suggest, particularly in LDS units, that you use the membership records and import those. BUT, those records do not cover every address in the unit, the addresses follow no standard, there are frequently duplicate records with different homeowner names (different households at the same address or old records that need to be moved out of the unit), etc. Just don't use them.

My ward has a printed map that I assume came from [this company](https://www.facebook.com/UTAH-Mapping-445791522151116/?ref=br_rs). It shows every street number and street name in our unit. This is important, because you must know the street name and address range you want in order to download from the online county records.

## Get the County Records
In Salt Lake, the County Assessor's office keeps the homeowner records. I went to the [Parcel Viewer](https://slco.org/assessor/new/query/intropage.cfm) application

## Consolidate the County Records onto one sheet

## Download the patchfunding records onto another sheet

## Normalize the patchfunding records

## match up the county records and the patchfunding records
