Today I was released from serving as the second counselor in the bishopric of our ward. My thoughts have been all over the place. It's customary for the presiding authority to ask for the person being released and the person being called to share their testimonies.

When I was called to serve as a counselor (and my wife was asked to support me), the guideline was that it would be a five year calling. This was a bit hard to take because we had already been thinking about moving. Home values were high, and interest rates were low. But then we heard who the new bishop was going to be. I remember saying to Amanda as we walked out of the church, 'I could stay five years for Ronnie.'

I have been taught that, within reason, we should always accept the callings that come to us from those we sustain as the Lord's servants. But you know, since June 2014 interest rates and home prices have only gotten better. But so what? I accepted the call to serve and any changes to that plan needed to come from Him. There have been several times were I've just wanted to run away--change my job, move, all of it. To be clear, nothing bad ever happeneded that made me feel that was necessary. It was just self-generated stress. I have a really great job. We have a comfortable home, and we're not house poor. Sure, the lawn isn't as green as it could be, the deck needs replaced, the fence needs repairs, and the bathrooms should be remodeled. But that's life, and every other home comes with the same issues.

The community where we live has it's struggles. In recent years, gang graffitti has been a consistent problem. I live towards the newer end of the community, and my neighbors do their best to keep it classy. But there's been a lot of hard times and it shows in some parts. The high school is known for being a little rough. We don't have any kids in high school or junior high here, but our friends do. Last year there was somewhat of an exodus from our neighborhood due to the great conditions in the home market. We lost several great families in our ward, and other wards in the stake had the same experience. It was hard to take. But the ones that are still here -- they make it work.

Before I served as a counselor in the bishopric, I was the eleven year old scout leader. My assignment in the bishopric had me overseeing the scout program, and I also volunteered to be the webmaster for our scout district. In short, I've done a lot of scouts in the last three years. I learned a ton, and my eyes were opened to remember some of the great things that others have done for me. Let me explain.

This last Tuesday I taught a merit badge instructor course.

I finished my Eagle Scout requirements on my 18th birthday. I just barely made it.
